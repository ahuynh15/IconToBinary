A simple and quick Unity Project that provides users a simple GUI for drawing a 'pixel' image and receiving immediate conversions to binary and hexadecimal.

The current layout and code is written for a 7x5 pixel image, but the UI components and the code can be modified to larger resolutions.
  - Each button in the matrix can be enabled and disable via a click
  - Whenever a button is pressed the binary and hexadecimal equivalents are updated

To run the project:
  1. Open the project in the Unity Engine (https://unity3d.com/)
  2. Build & Run the project via the 'file' menu
